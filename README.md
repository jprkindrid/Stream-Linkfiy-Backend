# Stream‚ÄëLinkify Backend (WIP)

Convert a track URL from one streaming provider (Spotify / Apple Music / TIDAL / Deezer currently) into equivalent track links (and metadata) on the other supported platforms.

</div>

> Status: Work in progress. Public contract and DTO shapes are still volatile; expect breaking changes.

## ‚ú® What It Does (Current Scope)

- Accepts a single track URL (Spotify, Apple Music, TIDAL) and returns a unified object containing the canonical metadata + cross‚Äëplatform URLs when resolvable.
- Normalizes lookups around ISRC (preferred) falling back to provider specific search heuristics.
- Generates/refreshes API access tokens for each provider (Spotify Client Credentials flow, Apple Music developer token (JWT), TIDAL token flow) on demand.
- Exposes a consolidation endpoint plus a few raw provider test endpoints (subject to removal/refactor).
- Provides OpenAPI docs (via Scalar) in Development at `/scalar`.

## üß± High Level Architecture

```
Client -> POST /api/UrlConversion/tracks (track URL)
				‚îî‚îÄ> Provider Input (Spotify, AppleMusic, etc.) parses + fetches base track attributes
							‚îú‚îÄ> Resolves ISRC & core metadata
							‚îú‚îÄ> Queries other providers by ISRC (or fallback search (by track name and primary artist))
							‚îî‚îÄ> Aggregates TrackReturnDto (original + alt URLs)

		-> POST /api/UrlConversion/albums (album URL)
				‚îî‚îÄ> Provider Input (Spotify, AppleMusic, etc.) parses + fetches base album attributes
							‚îú‚îÄ> Resolves UPC & core metadata
							‚îú‚îÄ> Queries other providers by UPC (or fallback search (by album name and primary artist))
							‚îî‚îÄ> Aggregates AlbumReturnDto (original + alt URLs)
```

Key layers:
- Controllers: HTTP surface (`UrlConversionController`, provider-specific test controllers like `SpotifyController`).
- Services: Provider logic (token retrieval, track search, mapping).
- DTOs: Strongly typed request/response shapes per provider.
- Mappers: Translate provider responses into internal unified model (`TrackReturnDto`).

## üì° Endpoints (Current)

| Method | Route | Description | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------|
| GET | `/` | Simple health/info | Returns basic message. |
| POST | `/api/UrlConversion/tracks` | Convert a provider track URL into cross‚Äëplatform links | Body: `{ "trackUrl": "..." }` |
| POST | `/api/UrlConversion/albums` | Convert a provider ALBUM URL into cross‚Äëplatform links | Body: `{ "albumUrl": "..." }` |

OpenAPI / Scalar UI available in Development: visit `/scalar` (it internally maps the OpenAPI doc produced by `builder.Services.AddOpenApi()` + `app.MapOpenApi()`).

### Example Request

POST `/api/UrlConversion/tracks`

```json
{
	"trackUrl": "https://open.spotify.com/track/43eLl2gwEr0fgbFgS11uOh"
}
```

### Example (Indicative) Response

Tracks:
```json
{
	"songName": "Example Track",
	"artistNames": "[Example Artist, Example Artist 2]",
    "albumName": "Example Album Name",
    "spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/track/...",
	"apple": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/.../track/...",
	"tidal": "https://listen.tidal.com/track/..."
	"deezer": "https://www.deezer.com/track/..."
}
```

Field names will solidify later; treat above as illustrative only.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

Prerequisites:
- .NET 9 SDK (project targets `net9.0` per build output folders)

Clone & run:
```pwsh
git clone <your-fork-or-origin>
cd Stream-Linkify-Backend
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run --project Stream-Linkify-Backend/Stream-Linkify-Backend.csproj
```

The app will expose HTTPS (Kestrel default). Visit `/scalar` in a browser (Development only) for interactive docs.

### Running Tests
```pwsh
dotnet test
```

Some smoke tests require provider credentials (set through user secrets / environment variables) and may be skipped/fail if secrets are missing.

## üîê Secrets & Credentials

No secrets should be committed. Current code looks up values via configuration and environment variables:

Apple Music (Developer Token):
- Config keys expected: `AppleMusicKit:TeamId`, `AppleMusicKit:KeyId`
- Private key: looked up from env var `APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY` (PEM contents) OR fallback file path `Keys/AuthKey_<KeyId>.p8`.
- Access JWT generated via `Services/Apple/AppleTokenService.cs` but can also be manually created and hard coded in secrets/environment variable
- Requires Apple Developer Account, which is a paid service.
- [Read about accessing Apple Music Kit developer credentials here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/generating-developer-tokens)

Spotify (Client Credentials):
- Expected config keys: `Spotify:ClientId`, `Spotify:ClientSecret` (names inferred; confirm or adjust as implemented in token service once added).
- Requires Spotify developer Account.
- [Read about accessing Spotify developer credentials here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/access-token)

TIDAL:
- Expected config keys: `Tidal:ClientId`, `Tidal:ClientSecret`.
- Requires Tidal developer Account.
- [Read about acceessing TIDAL developer credentials here](https://developer.tidal.com/documentation/api-sdk/api-sdk-quick-start)

### IMPORTANT: Do not commit Private Keys
The repository currently contains `.p8` Apple private key files under:
- `Stream-Linkify-Backend/Keys/AuthKey_<KeyId>.p8`
- `Stream-Linkify-Backend.Tests/Keys/AuthKey_<KeyId>.p8`

Add/keep `*.p8` in `.gitignore` (already present) and prefer loading via environment variable.

### Using User Secrets (Development)
From the project directory:
```pwsh
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "AppleMusicKit:TeamId" "<team_id>"
dotnet user-secrets set "AppleMusicKit:KeyId"  "<key_id>"
dotnet user-secrets set "Spotify:ClientId"     "<client_id>"
dotnet user-secrets set "Spotify:ClientSecret" "<client_secret>"
dotnet user-secrets set "Tidal:ClientId"     "<client_id>"
dotnet user-secrets set "Tidal:ClientSecret" "<client_secret>"
```
Then export the Apple private key as an environment variable (PowerShell):
```pwsh
$env:APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY = (Get-Content path\to\AuthKey_<KeyId>.p8 -Raw)
```
Optionally add to your profile for persistence.

## üß™ Smoke Tests Overview
Located in `Stream-Linkify-Backend.Tests`:
- `AppleServices_SmokeTests` - validates Apple Music developer token generation + basic track lookups (requires secrets & a test track URL / ISRC).
- `SpotifyServices_SmokeTests` - validates token acquisition and sample track / album retrieval.
- `TidalServices_SmokeTests` - validates token acquisition and sample track / album retrieval.
- `DeezerService_SmokeTests` - validates ample track/akbum retrieval as well as conversion of 'share' links.

## üì¶ Docker (Initial Skeleton)

There is a `Dockerfile` present. Typical build (ensure secrets provided via build args or runtime env vars - never bake secrets into layers):
```pwsh
docker build -t stream-linkify-backend .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development stream-linkify-backend
```
Inject runtime secrets using `-e` flags or a Docker secret management solution.

## üöß Roadmap (Planned / Ideas)

- Robust error envelope + problem details.
- Replace ad-hoc provider parsing with a pluggable strategy registry.
- Add caching (e.g., MemoryCache / Redis) for tokens + track metadata.
- Add database for existing searched tracks, call tracks from db first.
- Additional providers (YouTube Music, Deezer, SoundCloud - contingent on API feasibility).
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation (traces / metrics) + structured logging enrichment.
- Rate limiting / resiliency policies (Polly) around provider calls.
- CI workflow (build, test, security scan) + container publish.
